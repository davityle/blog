To have health or to have points. That is the question.

Recently I had my appendix removed after a short stint with appendicitis.

Hello World

{{< /read-more >}}

At 5 am Sunday morning I woke up from stomach pain. Thinking it was just the stomach flu I got out the saltine crackers and cola 
and tried sleeping it off. The pain persisted and in no time at all I was puking all over the floor—my wife says that I 
never make it to the toilet. I decided that this stomach flu was bad enough that I probably wouldn't be able keep my teaching
commitments at Church that day. So I contacted my teaching companion and asked him to cover for me, grabbed the cola, and 
got ready to ride out this stomach flu. That never really happened. Throughout the day the pain increased gradually. 
Eventually, my stomach was really starting to hurt and I realized that I needed to go to the hospital. 

My wife drove me to the emergency room where I got out and went to check in while she tried finding a place to park. 
I went into emergency room and stood behind a family that was checking in in front of me. I guess I must have looked 
pretty bad because they hurriedly finished up and beckoned for me to sit down in front of the check in desk. I guess I 
didn't realize how much pain I was in because I thought I would be able to check myself in without a problem but it started
hurting too much to talk. Something about the pressure in my stomach that talking created. So I handed the receptionist
my insurance card and driver's licence and did as little talking as possible. Then it really started to hurt.

Looking back at it now I laugh because I must have looked like an idiot—you're probably kinder to my past, in pain, self and 
won't think that this is funny—but I started pacing back and forth and grunting in pain. I'm sure that it was only at 
most 10 minutes before they called my in to take my vitals but it felt much longer than that.

About an hour after I was diagnosed via CT scan the surgeon came in to talk with me and my wife. He explained how the surgery works
